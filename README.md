- Hello World‚úåüèø My name is Lunden. Im a beginner developer out of North Carolina.

- Ive been programming for about a week and I really wanna jump head first into this thing. Im planning on learning 
   html, css, js, python, java, c, c++, and c# in that order if possible. Then maybe SQL if the need arises.

- I want to go full stack as fast as possible, but I want to be diligent. Skipping steps seems stupid. Im just screwing around in html/css 
   designing random website layouts to get more comfortable.
   
- Im a fairly introverted dude, other than development im into jazz guitar, psychology and western philosophy lmao. I somehow got my girlfriend
   to fall in love with Minecraft so weve been on that hard lately.
   
- Im just looking to collaborate with new people. Trying to take the first step into the development community!
  
- Anyone can reach me at my email: "lunden.e@icloud.com" or add me on snapchat "@zaire.l". Ill be posting my first little project soon.
